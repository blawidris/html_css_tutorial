# HTML Attributes

An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag.

All attributes are made up of two parts âˆ’ a name and a value

_syntax_
`<p align="center">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Optio, facere</p>`

### Most Common Attributes

1. id: used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.

   **Reasons why we use id**

   - If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just that element and its content.

   - If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.

2. title: gives a suggested title for the element. Mostly appear when you place cursor on an element

   _example_

   `<a href="#" title="google">Click here</a>`

3. class: used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of element. You can have more than 1 class value

   _example_

   `<a href="#" title="google" class="btn btn-primary">Click here</a>`

4. Style: allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.

   _example_

   `<a href="#" title="google" class="btn btn-primary" style = "font-family:arial; color:#FF0000;">Click here</a>`

HTML attribute varies based on type of element used.

Other attribute includes:

- width: Specifies the width of tables, images, or table cells.
- height: Specifies the height of tables, images, or table cells.
